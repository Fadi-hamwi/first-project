 The answer is : 3600 + 7686 + 63 + 8910 + 11 + 854 = 21124
 First
 Numbers 1-9

There is no particular pattern in the first numbers, so all we can do is spell them out and count them.

3 + 3 + 5 +4 + 4 +3 +5 +5 +4 = 36

Numbers 20-99

Now a pattern starts emerging. For each period of ten numbers, we have a prefix 10 times and then the sequence 1-9, which we have already counted.  So we need to figure out how many letters the tens contain and add 8*36.

10*(6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 6) + 8*36 = 748

So if we sum that up the number 1-99 will contain 36 + 70 + 74 8= 854 letters

Numbers 100-999

We will use sort of the same trick here.

If we look at one hundred and twenty two (122) and  four hundred and fifty three (453). We will see that the number 1-9 is prepended, then comes the words “hundred and” (10 letters), and last comes a number between 1 and 99.  Whole hundreds such as two hundred (200) are a special case where you have the numbers 1-9 followed by “hundred” (7 letters).

If we break it down we have the numbers 1-9 occurring 100 times each. => 36*100 = 3600

1-99 occurring 9 times => 9*854 = 7686

Project Euler 17: Letters in the numbers 1-1000

Problem 17 of Project Euler changes character completely compared to the previous exercises. The problem reads

    If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

    If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

    NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of “and” when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

 

If we just wanted to write them out and count them, it would take a long time. So we will have to make some pattern analysis. I have solved in without using a computer, but I am fairly sure you can turn the analysis into a general algorithm.
Numbers 1-9

There is no particular pattern in the first numbers, so all we can do is spell them out and count them.

3 + 3 + 5 +4 + 4 +3 +5 +5 +4 = 36
Numbers 10-19

There is also too little pattern in the next 10 numbers that I want to make a deal out of it, so if we count those as well we get

3 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 70
Numbers 20-99

Now a pattern starts emerging. For each period of ten numbers, we have a prefix 10 times and then the sequence 1-9, which we have already counted.  So we need to figure out how many letters the tens contain and add 8*36.

10*(6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 6) + 8*36 = 748

So if we sum that up the number 1-99 will contain 36 + 70 + 74 8= 854 letters
Numbers 100-999

We will use sort of the same trick here.

If we look at one hundred and twenty two (122) and  four hundred and fifty three (453). We will see that the number 1-9 is prepended, then comes the words “hundred and” (10 letters), and last comes a number between 1 and 99.  Whole hundreds such as two hundred (200) are a special case where you have the numbers 1-9 followed by “hundred” (7 letters).

If we break it down we have the numbers 1-9 occurring 100 times each. => 36*100 = 3600

1-99 occurring 9 times => 9*854 = 7686

We have “hundred” occurring 9 times with 7 letters. => 7*9 = 63

We have “hundred and” occurring 999 times with 10 letters => 999*10 = 8910

So in total we have

3600 + 7686 + 63 + 8910= 20259
Finally 
We still miss one thousand which is another 11 letters, so in total we have 854 + 20259 + 11 = 21124 letters in the numbers 1-1000
