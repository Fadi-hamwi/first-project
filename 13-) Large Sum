In this problem you need to add the numbers line by line and finally there are too many ways to show the first ten digits like :
    1-convert it to a string and take the first ten digits 
    2-compute the length of the number using this method (floor(log10(number)) + 1) or (you can convert to a string and back to a number) 
    and then divide the number by 10^(length(number) - 10)
